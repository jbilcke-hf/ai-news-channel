        "content":"The Chiefs staggered around the AFC West with , and the Broncos helped pay for their Uber back to the playoffs. Windows are fickle, finite beasts. Sean Payton managed to touch 2023’s sill with his pinkie before tripping over the curtains and eating his visor. Kansas City kept dropping passes and daring somebody — anybody — else in the division to make it a race. Nobody bit. If that doesn’t chafe Broncos Country, this might: Imagine if the . Or if the Raiders nabbed Bill Belichick. Year 1 of Payton and Russell Wilson was about seeing if the marriage could work because an early divorce would be painful. , and the Broncos’ offseason shopping list now feels : Which means, that until the next window opens up, at Dove Valley should be untouchable. is about to slingshot general manager George Paton into salary-cap purgatory, and his calls to Santa are going straight to voicemail. If somebody’s charitable enough to dangle a Day 2 pick for mercurial Jerry Jeudy? Sayonara, 10. If somebody offers a Day 3 pick for Courtland Sutton, let alone two? Godspeed, 14. Justin Simmons? Ask for the moon and the stars, but you ask. And if your buddy guffaws when you suggest trading Pro Bowl corner to move up in the draft, or to land a better option at QB than Jarrett Stidham, quiz him or she to see if they can name any of the starting corners for the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII this past February. Off the top of their heads. No Googling. Or Andy Reid’s CB1 and CB2 at Super Bowl LIV. Or Tampa Bay’s two starting corners at Super Bowl LV. PS2 is to cornerbacks what Anthony Munoz was to left tackles a generation or two back. A one-man eraser. So good, so dominant, and so consistent, you almost forget he’s there. Shutdown corners are blessed and rare. And yet, of the last 10 NFL champions, just five featured at least one starting cornerback who was a first-round draft pick. As a point of comparison, every one of those 10 featured a quarterback with at least one Pro Bowl berth on their respective resume. As a point of what should be rage, nine of those 10 champs featured a top-flight No. 1 tight end with a Pro Bowl pedigree. At 23 years old and with two Pro Bowl nods already over his first three seasons in Denver, Surtain is the kind of luxury item coaches dream about. But if the Broncos cut Big Russ, he might also become the kind of luxury a cap-strapped franchise can’t afford. PS2 has a season and a fifth-year option remaining on his rookie deal, with a reported $5.7 million cap hit in 2023 and a $6.66 hit slated for 2024. recently that Surtain on the open market should rake in roughly $24 million to $27 million annually. There are creative ways to shove that money down the road, yes, but it takes two sides to tango. Payton’s Saints history says he’ll max the cap out like a low-interest credit card and kick any and all dead money as far as the CBA allows. That’s somebody else’s problem, even if it is his fault. It’s funny, though: The Broncos had the best defensive back on the field at Allegiant Stadium this past Sunday, but that didn’t stop Davante Adams from schooling Ja’Quan McMillian. Or Tre Tucker torching Fabian Moreau for kicks. With Surtain patrolling his house, rookie Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell still threw for 244 yards, two scores, zero picks (PS2 had one slip through his mitts), and a 110.1 passer rating — the former Purdue star’s second-highest of the season. It’s not Surtain’s fault the Broncos haven’t found a running mate who can protect the other boundary. Or that the defense often was only as good as Moreau was at holding up his side of the bargain. In an uncapped world, you’d move Heaven and Earth before you’d move PS2. The Broncos don’t live there anymore. And the only thing at Centura Health Training Center that oughta be nailed down is Payton’s ego.",

        "content":"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The United States and the United Kingdom said the elections that extended Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s rule were not credible, free and fair. Both countries, which have trade and development ties with Bangladesh, also condemned political violence that preceded Sunday’s election in which Hasina’s party won more than two-thirds of the parliamentary seats while turnout was low and the main opposition party boycotted. “The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day. The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated,” State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller said from Washington. He urged Bangladesh’s government to credibly investigate reports of violence and hold those responsible accountable. The U.K. said the democratic standards were not met consistently in the lead-up to the election. “Democratic elections depend on credible, open, and fair competition. Respect for human rights, rule of law and due process are essential elements of the democratic process. These standards were not consistently met during the election period. We are concerned at the significant number of arrests of opposition party members before polling day,” the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in the statement. The U.S. statement said it remains “committed to partnering with Bangladesh to advance our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, to supporting human rights and civil society in Bangladesh, and to deepening our people-to-people and economic ties.” Bangladesh is an important partner of the U.S. interest in the Indo-Pacific region along with neighboring India amid growing influence of China. China, Russia, India and some other countries congratulated Hasina for the victory and pledged to continue to partner with the South Asian nation. The statements came after Hasina said at a news conference Monday that the elections were free and fair. Her ruling Awami League won 222 seats of 299 contested. Independent candidates took 62, while the Jatiya Party, the third largest, took 11 seats and three smaller parties got 3 seats. The result in one seat remained undeclared. The election of one seat was postponed because a candidate died. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and its allies boycotted the election, and voter turnout was a low 41.8%. While election day was relatively calm, a wave of violence preceded the vote. Zia’s party said more than 20,000 supporters had been arrested since Oct. 28 when an anti-government rally turned violent in Dhaka. The government disputed the figures and said arrests were for specific charges such as arson and vandalism. Bangladesh has a history of political violence, military coups and assassinations. Hasina and Zia governed the country alternately for many years, cementing a feud that has since polarized Bangladesh’s politics and fueled violence around elections. This year’s vote raised questions over its credibility when there are no major challengers to take on the incumbent.",

        "description":"\"I only had one full healthy season there. I was there for seven years.\" The post A candid Chris Sale explains why he doesn’t think Red Sox tenure was a success appeared first on Boston.com.",
        "content":"By Chris Sale made an instant impact with the Red Sox after he was traded from the White Sox in a blockbuster deal in December 2016. In his first season with Boston, he finished second in the AL Cy Young Award voting and ninth in AL MVP voting, going 17-8 with a 2.90 ERA and a whopping 308 strikeouts in 214.1 innings of work. In 2018, he played a key role in Boston’s run to a World Series title — posting a 2.11 ERA over 27 starts. He secured the Red Sox’ fourth title in the last two decades by striking out Manny Machado with a filthy slider. Chris Sale strikes out Machado for the final out!! But despite his impressive start to his tenure in Boston, that he doesn’t view his entire seven-season run with the Red Sox as a complete success. A majority of Sale’s time with the Red Sox was marred by injury. After signing a five-year, $145 million extension with Boston, Sale only logged 298.1 innings from 2019-23. He missed the entire 2020 season due to Tommy John surgery, while landing on the shelf several other times due to a myriad of freak accidents and other ailments. In just his second start of the 2022 season, Sale after getting struck by a line drive by Yankees outfielder Aaron Hicks. Boston expected Sale to return later that season, but he was ruled out for the rest of the year just weeks later after “In my mind, no, it was not (a success), because of a couple reasons,” Sale said Monday. “I only had one full healthy season there. I was there for seven years. I only pitched tip-to-tip one time, in 2017, and that was actually the best year of my career from like a stat standpoint. 2018 was probably close to, if not, the second-best year of my career. I missed some time, but had a great year, and we did end up winning the World Series. “I didn’t do anything post-contract, which bothers me. If we would have won the World Series after I signed that contract, I’d have felt maybe a little bit better. But I got traded there, we won a World Series and they obviously made a big commitment to me and rewarded me for having two good years and bringing a championship to that city. ‘Hey, we’re going all in on you. We’ve done our end of the bargain. Here’s five years. Here’s a big contract. Now you get to go keep doing what you’re doing.’ Because they saw those two previous years and that’s what they thought they had signed up for five more years. And it wasn’t. “The best years of my baseball career were in Boston, but also the worst years of my career were in Boston. And if those worst years weren’t, just to be completely honest, so (expletive) expensive… It’s a kick, it’s a gut punch. It’s not a fun thing that I’ll be able to look back on and remember about my life and my career. But I learned a lot from it. I’d like to think you can take some good with bad and roll with the punches. It’s a mixed bag, but overall, I guess in short answer, if it was one word, I would say no.” Sale explaining why his time in Boston was not a success was a good watch. Players aren’t this candid too often. Really good interview on . Sale was ultimately traded by Boston , with the 34-year-old lefty signing a two-year, $38 million extension with Atlanta last week.

        "content":"A salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least two dozen people across 14 states has been linked to charcuterie trays sold at hundreds of Sam's Club stores, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ). Fratelli Beretta USA, also known as Busseto Foods, has initiated a recall of more than 11,000 pounds of meat after the salmonella outbreak was traced to one of their ready-to-eat products, Busseto Foods' Charcuterie Sampler, which is sold at 323 Sam's Clubs in 27 states, Sam's officials said in an online statement. Officials with the members-only warehouse chain that sells bulk grocery items, electronics and household goods said that as soon as they were notified of possible contamination, they \"immediately instructed all our clubs\" to remove the samplers, which contained prosciutto, sweet sopressata and dry coppa. The Busseto Charcuterie Sampler is sold at Sam's Club as a twin pack with two 9-ounce packages that contain lot code L075330300 and a best-by date of April 27, 2024. The recalled meats also include the establishment number \"EST. 7543B\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The contaminated charcuterie samplers were produced on October 30, 2023, and shipped to Sam's Club distribution centers in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, according to the CDC. Illnesses have been reported in Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. As of Monday night, each state listed reported one case of illness except for Ohio, which has reported 11 cases, according to the CDC, which noted that the number of sick across the U.S. is likely \"much higher.\" Cases often go unreported because people don't get tested for the foodborne illness, especially since many people recover at home, the agency said. The ages of the 24 people with reported infections range from 16 to 91 years old, the CDC said. There have been no deaths. reached out via email on Monday to representatives for the CDC and Sam's Club for comment. On January 3, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the CDC and state public health officials announced that they were investigating a salmonella outbreak. Officials with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture alerted federal authorities after an unopened, intact, charcuterie sampler tested positive for a strain of the foodborne illness. \"Further traceback of the charcuterie meat used to produce the recalled products is ongoing,\" FSIS officials said in an online statement. reached out via email to FSIS on Monday for comment. Marco Lastrico, spokesperson for Busseto Foods, told in an email on Monday night that the recalled products are sold only at Sam's Club. Lastrico said at the time of publication that the company did not have \"any additional comments to add beyond the information provided in the FSIS recall notice. The company is fully cooperating with the authorities on this matter.\" Consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, which can cause symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within six hours to six days after eating the item, FSIS said in the recall alert. The illness usually lasts between four and seven days. While most people recover without needing treatment, some can experience such severe diarrhea that they require hospitalization. Older adults, infants, and those with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe illness, health officials warned. \"FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers' refrigerators,\" the federal health agency said. \"Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\" Shoppers who believe they have purchased the affected charcuterie product can return the item to their local store for a full refund, Sam's Club officials said.

        "content":"Researchers have developed a deep learning-based AI algorithm that automatically analyzes chest X-rays to rapidly detect COVID-19 infection with more than 98% accuracy, distinguishing between normal X-rays and X-rays from people with pneumonia, which often presents with the same symptoms as COVID. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is the most widely used method of diagnosing COVID-19 infection. But there are issues with using real-time PCR testing: it’s costly, results can be slow, and it’s prone to producing false negatives. As an adjunct, CT scans of the chest and chest X-rays also play a role in the timely detection and management of contagious infections, especially when RT-PCR returns a negative result. COVID-19 produces particular radiological ‘signatures’ in chest X-rays that radiologists use to diagnose infection with the virus. However, meticulously examining X-rays for signs of infection is time-consuming and, because it relies on the human eye, may not always be accurate. So, researchers at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) enlisted the help of AI to streamline the diagnostic process. “The most widely used COVID-19 test, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can be slow and costly and produces false negatives,” said Amir Gandomi, corresponding author of the study. “To confirm a diagnosis, radiologists need to manually examine CT scans or X-rays, which can be time-consuming and prone to error.” The other complicating factor is that the symptoms of COVID-19 infection – fever, cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat – can be difficult to distinguish from other respiratory viral infections, such as flu or pneumonia. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have gained popularity in medicine, assisting doctors in diagnosing , detecting , and predicting and . Deep learning, a subfield of AI, is particularly well-suited to creating a model that can produce accurate results from input data without requiring manual feature extraction. In the current study, the researchers developed a deep-learning-based algorithm called a Custom Convolutional Neural Network (Custom-CNN), specifically designed for diagnosing COVID-19. Two freely available chest X-ray datasets were used to test and train the AI model. The datasets comprised three categories of chest X-ray images: normal, coronavirus-positive, and viral pneumonia. To train the Custom-CNN model, 80% of the total images were used, while 20% were reserved for testing. The objective of the study was to assess the model's effectiveness in examining various relationships, including coronavirus and viral pneumonia, normal and viral pneumonia, and coronavirus and normal, and the associations among the three classes of X-ray images. Results demonstrated that the Custom-CNN model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.19% in its classification of COVID, normal and pneumonia image samples. Comparing the model’s results to those obtained using other models, the Custom-CNN outperformed them all. “Deep learning offers an end-to-end solution, eliminating the need to manually search for biomarkers,” Gandomi said. “The Custom-CNN model streamlines the detection process, providing a faster and more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.” The early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection can ensure that patients get the correct treatment, including antivirals, which work best if taken within five days of the onset of symptoms. It could also encourage them to isolate and protect others from getting infected. “The new AI system could be particularly beneficial in countries experiencing high levels of COVID-19 where there is a shortage of radiologists,” said Gandomi. “Chest X-rays are portable, widely available and provide lower exposure to ionizing radiation than CT scans.” The study was published in the journal .

After a 4-13 season that ended with Belichick for most losses taken by a head coach, anything is possible. That includes Belichick returning for his 25th season. It's not a foregone conclusion that Belichick will be coaching elsewhere in 2024. The 71-year-old will meet with team owner Robert Kraft this week to discuss the future. If Belichick does remain with the Patriots, it's clear that changes need to be made. One change could include bringing back a familiar face. , Josh McDaniels is considered a candidate to return to New England if Belichick remains as head coach. McDaniels, who spent the past one-and-a-half seasons as head coach of the , was earlier this year after a 3-5 start. The Patriots offense has struggled since McDaniels took the job in Vegas. New England has ranked in the bottom seven in yards of total offense per game in each of the last two seasons, and was tied in having the worst scoring offense in the league this year (13.9 points per game). The Patriots finished in last place in the AFC East for the first time since 2000, which snapped the second-longest active streak in the NFL. There's plenty to be figured out in New England, but if Belichick and Kraft avoid divorce, keep an eye on McDaniels.",

The first out of the gate? , which follows Alaqua Cox’s Maya Lopez, aka Echo, a deaf Native American Choctaw and former criminal gang leader. She was introduced in the show . Did you not watch ? Allegedly it doesn’t matter. Echo has her own contained storyline, in which she seeks to avenge her father’s murder after learning the culprit is her former mentor, Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio). But when does come out? Very, very soon. The show is set to hit both Disney+ and Hulu on Tuesday, January 9. What’s more, they’re not doing a traditional staggered release, as they’ve done with other shows. All five episodes, each about 45 minutes long, are set to drop on the same day. Yes, there’s some overlap with the greater MCU. D’Onofrio’s Kingpin was originally seen in the , whose star, Charlie Cox, also makes an appearance, at least.

        "content":"World Filing in Georgia Trump Case Claims ‘Improper’ Relationship Between Prosecutors By Julia Carroll - January 9, 2024 A legal representative for a defendant charged alongside ex-president, Donald J. Trump in a Georgia election meddling case, claimed in a court document that a covert affair existed between District Attorney Fani T. Willis and the special prosecutor she appointed for the case. The document, written by a representative of Michael A. Roman who is a former official from the Trump campaign, didn’t offer evidence of these accusations or any others listed. The lawyer argued that the supposed relationship warrants disqualification of Ms. Willis, her office, and the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, from prosecuting the case. Ashleigh B. Merchant, the defense lawyer, also mentioned that Ms. Willis, who serves as the district attorney in Fulton County, Ga., is profiting significantly from this case at taxpayers’ cost, alleging that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade have vacationed together using funds earned from her office. Merchant, citing “information gathered outside of court documents,” indicated that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade made personal trips together to locations such as Napa Valley, Florida, and the Caribbean, while Mr. Wade bought cruise tickets for both. Furthermore, Merchant argues in the filing that Ms. Willis did not secure the required approval to appoint Mr. Wade and, as a result, the case should be dismissed. Mr. Wade is one of the several outside lawyers whom Ms. Willis’s office has hired to assist with the complex Trump case, a racketeering indictment involving 15 persons. The impact of these claims on the Georgia prosecution, one of several criminal cases against Mr. Trump, remains unclear. Mr. Trump, the ex-president, submitted several motions in the case, including one where his lawyers argue he is immune from prosecution in this case. Georgia State University law and ethics professor, Clark D. Cunningham, reviewed Mr. Roman’s filing and raised questions about its lack of proof regarding a relationship between the two prosecutors. “If actual evidence of an improper relationship between Willis and Wade exists, it was Merchant’s responsibility to include this in her motion, for example, by attaching sworn affidavits from witnesses with personal knowledge or authenticated documents,” he said in an email. Merchant, during a phone interview, shared that she reviewed documents indicating that Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis traveled together to holiday destinations and that some of the tickets were purchased by Mr. Wade. She believes these records are included in Mr. Wade’s sealed divorce files, and she requested in a separate court document this week that those records be made public. These allegations by Ms. Merchant were first publicized by The Atlanta-Journal Constitution. They were part of a 39-page motion filed in Fulton County Superior Court on behalf of Mr. Roman, a Trump campaign official in 2020 involved in a scheme to mobilize pro-Trump electors in Georgia despite Mr. Trump’s loss there. Mr. Roman is accused of seven counts, including conspiracy to commit forgery and a violation of Georgia’s racketeering law. Jeff DiSantis, a representative for Ms. Willis’s office, simply stated that the office will “respond appropriately in court.” In the motion, Merchant wrote that this document wasn’t submitted lightly, and it wasn’t submitted without significant premeditation, research, or investigation. As per her submission, Merchant claimed to have sources close to Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade who confirmed an ongoing personal relationship between the two that started before Ms. Willis appointed Mr. Wade for the Trump case. The submission mentions that Mr. Wade, who runs a private practice, has garnered over $650,000 from his work with the prosecutor’s office.

An illegal immigrant from El Salvador who had been arrested multiple times in Boulder, Colorado for DWI and deported, was arrested once again last month in Colorado after allegedly killing a mother and her son in a car crash, which police say involved alcohol. The Broomfield Police Department arrested 37-year-old Jose Guadalupe Menjivar-Alas on Dec. 15, 2023, in connection with a fatal crash three days prior on Main Street and Miramonte Boulevard. Menjivar-Alas was driving a Toyota Tundra that crashed into a Mazda CX-5 driven by 47-year-old Melissa Powell. Powell’s son, Riordan, was also in the Mazda, and they were both killed in the crash. An investigation into the crash led detectives to believe alcohol and speed contributed to the crash. MAYORKAS BLAMES MEXICO, CONGRESS FOR HISTORIC BORDER SURGE; CALLS FOR MORE FUNDING AND ‘REFORM’ Jose Guadalupe Menjivar-Alas is an illegal immigrant from El Salvador. (Broomfield Police Department) Menjivar-Alas was transported to a local hospital after the crash, and once released, he was booked into the Broomfield County Jail and charged with vehicular homicide from reckless driving, vehicular homicide caused by DUI and habitual traffic offender. U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News Digital Menjivar-Alas, a citizen of El Salvador, has been deported from the U.S. four times. \"ICE records show that the subject has been previously removed and has no regard for immigration law,\" an ICE spokesman said.

((Immigration and Customs Enforcement)) Menjivar-Alas was first convicted of DWI on Aug. 4, 2007, and received subsequent convictions for the same offense on Dec. 7, 2016 and May 7, 2019. He was also convicted of driving with alcohol on Sept. 16, 2007. An immigration judge issued Menjivar-Alas’ first order of removal on April 14, 2009. He was then removed from the U.S. in June 2009, June 2013, November 2014 and January 2015.

(John Moore/Getty Images) Despite being deported, Menjivar-Alas continued to make his way back into the country, where he was arrested numerous other times, and now allegedly killed a mother and her son. According to ICE, the Denver field office lodged an immigration detainer with Broomfield County on Dec. 18, 2023.

        "content":"Blizzard's Diablo IV launched on PC with DLSS 3 Frame Generation support, boosting performance for all GeForce RTX 40 Series owners. At the time, both NVIDIA and Blizzard mentioned that ray-tracing was coming to the game at some point, and at CES 2024, we finally got confirmation that ray-tracing is headed to Diablo 4 this March. Hot off the heels of a well-received Season of Blood that fixed many of the game's launch and end-game criticisms, 2024 for Diablo 4 will see the arrival of new seasons, an itemization and loot overhaul, new end-game ladder activities, and the first story-based expansion called Vessel of Hatred coming later in the year. As for going RTX On, Diablo 4's real-time ray-tracing effects cover ray-traced reflections, ray-traced transparent reflections, and enhanced ray-traced shadows. NVIDIA showcased the new RT effects at CES 2024, and in the trailer above, you can see the new ray-traced reflections and shadows in action with DLSS 3 Frame Generation enabled. With DLSS 3 and RT On, we can see 4K gameplay hit close to 150fps - which is impressive. This footage was probably captured with a GeForce RTX 4090 or the new GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER; neither the video nor the announcement don't specify the GPU being used. Either way, with ray-tracing, the visuals in Diablo 4 do improve. The effect is subtle at a glance, but as someone who played hundreds of hours of Diablo 4 in 2023, the improved shadow detail is immediately noticeable - adding more depth to the game's dark and gothic caves and dungeons.",

        "content":"The Biden administration has made it clear that there are no spaces for women. Not locker rooms or sports teams or rape crisis centers. One of the concerns of \"transphobes\" like J.K. Rowling is the housing of biological men in women's prisons. A man can commit a crime, claim during the trial that he identifies as a woman, and be sentenced to a women's facility. We have no idea why the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department decided to release this statement today, but they did. They're saying that gender dysphoria is covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act and they're committed to providing \"needed medical care\" to incarcerated trans women. Justice Department Files Statement of Interest in Lawsuit Concerning Treatment for Gender Dysphoria in Correctional Settings OK, now we know why they posted this today; the Justice Department in a lawsuit in Georgia: Doe, an incarcerated transgender woman, alleges that the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) has violated her rights under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and the U.S. Constitution by denying necessary medical care to treat her gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition that arises when a person experiences significant distress or impairment because of an incongruence between their gender identity and assigned sex. Left untreated, individuals with gender dysphoria can experience significant adverse mental health outcomes. Doe alleges that the GDC has denied her adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria, including gender-affirming surgery that has been recommended by four clinicians and consistent hormone therapy. Because of the inadequate care and exacerbation of her gender dysphoria, Doe has engaged in repeated self-harm, including attempts at suicide and self-castration. Doe seeks a preliminary injunction that would grant her access to medically necessary treatment for her gender dysphoria. “The protections of the U.S. Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act do not stop at the doorsteps of our jails and prisons,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia. “Our office remains committed to ensuring that all people with disabilities, including those with gender dysphoria, continue to receive access to such medically necessary treatments, even while they are in custody.” So the statement of interest argues that gender dysphoria can be a covered disability under the ADA. Seriously? We're not lawyers (well, Aaron Walker is), but we don't see how gender dysphoria is a \"disability.\" And they want the prison system to provide this criminal with \"gender-affirming surgery.\" Man, I wish Norm MacDonald was alive to reply to this There is no \"constitutional right\" to force others to adopt your delusional self perception. Oh, it's a disability? I feel very bad for the queering impaired. So it’s a disability now? Interesting So now trans people, who claim they're the target of genocide, have even more special protections under the law. Tell the cops you identify as a woman when they cite you for parking in a handicapped spot. If it’s a disability, that should bar them from military service, right? Can’t have it both ways… I don't think they'll like that since they tell everybody they're normal. You know you’re clowns right They can seek their nonsense after they have served their time. End of story See? Once again two different arguments. Which is it? They are really women or they are mentally ill? Every single argument or position libs take they take one that directly contradicts it somewhere else. So it’s not a mental illness until it’s convenient to be a mental illness? Hey, you may not want to hear this but, the only adults at the table already know it’s nothing more than mental illness. So Kristen Clarke is perfectly ok with real women getting raped in prisons by mentally-ill men who pretend to be women. Got it. Last March, at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, Attorney General Merrick Garland when Sen. Lindsey Graham told him that 1,200 federal prisoners were petitioning to be transferred to women's prisons. \"Are you concerned that if a biological male was sent to a female prison, that could be a risk to female prisoners,\" Graham asked. Garland: \"I think every, uh, uh, person in prison has to be dealt with, uh, with dignity and respect.\" Except women. So you are finally admitting that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder. Dysphoria is a psychiatric medical condition. They should receive mental health services. Forcing others to play into their delusion only furthers their psychosis. You are harming them, not helping. Under the ADA, only reasonable accommodations are required. This lawsuit extends beyond reasonable and necessary care, claiming a violation for refusing to provide an elective surgery. Elective surgeries are not required to be provided under the ADA. But they said in their statement it was \"needed medical care.\" You are not serious people Ludicrous position. In no way does the ADA require \"We the People\" to be obligated for transgender treatment. They're seriously arguing that sex change operations on prisoners are covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ***",

The Guadalajara born driver suffered a torrid season of racing at the helm of the RB19. While his teammate, dominated in the car, Perez finished a staggering 290 points adrift in 2nd. On more than more occasion, Perez even struggled to qualify into Q3, with his average grid slot being a lowly 9th. In this background, Horner also spoke about Perez’s potential replacements. While the team are confident they have a strong pool of drivers within the Red Bull family, the Briton has not ruled out the possibility of a driver market acquisition when he admitted, Perez has to be at his absolute best in 2024. While the RB19’s supremacy ensured the Bulls won everything with ease despite Perez’s fumbles, 2024 may not grant such an advantage. Many teams like Mercedes, Ferrari and McLaren are tipped to substantially close the gap, meaning Perez will have to be firing on all cylinders to ensure his team retains its crown. 2024 could be the year when Red Bull finally yield the top spot to their rivals In 2023, Red Bull had a clear advantage over the field. This resulted in them winning 21 out of the 22 races, whilst sealing P1 in the constructors’ and a 1-2 in the driver’s standings to round off a historic year for the team in the sport.

He will have to match Verstappen, whilst also ensuring he keeps the competition behind him. If he fails to fulfil his objectives and finishes anything below 2nd in the standings, Red Bull will be tempted to part ways and look to bring on a more formidable teammate, for Verstappen.

        "content":"Lindsay Lohan looked, “like, really pretty” at the premiere of the new “Mean Girls” movie musical. Lohan, who famously portrayed Cady Heron in the 2004 cult classic comedy, stunned in a black-cut out dress with silver crystals on Monday at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City. She posed with the original movie’s writer and the new movies’ screenwriter, Tina Fey, as well as “Saturday Night Live” founder Lorne Michaels, who produced the first flick. “It’s stood the test of time,” Lohan, 37, told Entertainment Tonight on the carpet about being part of the first movie. “I feel really grateful. I mean, it’s not very often that you have all these movies that do that. ‘Mean Girls’ really opened the doors for a lot of things going on in schools. I think it’s also a really fun movie, so it’s really a blessing.” Lohan also snapped photos with Megan Thee Stallion whose song “Not My Fault,” with the new Regina George, actress Reneé Rapp appears in the upcoming film, which is a musical based on the Broadway show. She even put her arm around Angourie Rice, the actress who portrays the new Heron, on the carpet, seemingly approving of the newbie taking over the iconic role. People asked the “Falling for Christmas” star , who welcomed her first child, Luai, over the summer with her husband, Bader Shammas , 37, whether she “identifies as a cool mom,” per one of the many quotable “Mean Girls” lines. “I hope so,” Lohan laughed. OG “Mean Girls” stars Amanda Seyfried, 38, and Lacey Chabert, 41, reunited with Lohan for a series of Walmart Black Friday ads in 2023 while Rachel McAdams, 45, was noticeably absent. Lohan told ET on Monday that the trio “always talk about” reprising their legendary roles. “The three of us are friends. I love Amanda and she’s done so well with her career. She’s such a great actress and Lacey as well. We’re good friends and that’s what matters most.” McAdams later addressed why she didn’t participate in the nostalgic ads. “I don’t know; I guess I wasn’t that excited about doing a commercial if I’m being totally honest,” she told Variety . ”A movie sounded awesome, but I’ve never done commercials, and it just didn’t feel like my bag,” the Oscar nominee continued. “Also … I didn’t know that everyone was doing it. I would, of course, always love to be a part of a ‘Mean Girls’ reunion and hang with my plastics, but yeah, I found that out later,” McAdams claimed. The new “Mean Girls” hits theaters on Jan. 12.",

However, the Warriors star’s actions were inexcusable. Some would argue his 12-game suspension was lighter than what he deserved. As genuine as his remorse is, his actions will determine his future. If Green fails to keep his temper in check, the league needs to prioritize the safety and well-being of the players affected by his actions. Perhaps an early retirement shouldn’t be out of consideration if he cannot control his violent urges.

Just as Green was eyeing a return, veteran guard suffered a fractured arm and is expected to be sidelined for a while. The Warriors’ dismal 2023 form is extending into 2024. It remains to be seen whether Green’s return and reunion with the Splash Brothers can turn the tide around. Advertisement",

        "content":"Maren Morris and Ryan Hurd have agreed to divorce settlement terms. According to court documents obtained by ET, the exes have agreed to share custody of their 3-year-old son, Hayes, nearly three months after Morris filed for divorce . According to the docs, Morris is listed as her son's primary residential parent, though both she and Hurd will have their son for 182.5 days per year. The exes will alternate time with their son on a week-to-week basis, with the nonpossessory parent getting additional time with Hayes on Wednesdays as well as two FaceTime calls, the docs show. They will divide holidays based on whether it's an even or odd year, and agreed that they will work together to accommodate each other's work travel schedules, per the docs. The docs show that Morris and Hurd agree that whichever of them has Hayes can make day-to-day decisions about him, while all major decisions -- extracurricular, health, religious and educational -- will be made jointly. Hurd's monthly income is listed as just over $41,000, while Morris' is listed more than $210,000, meaning the latter parent will pay the former $2,100 per month. Should a disagreement about the custody arrangement arise, Morris and Hurd, who married in 2018, agreed to have mediation by a neutral party, the docs show. As Morris and Hurd's divorce awaits official court approval, the docs show that the exes agreed that their prenuptial agreement was valid, the terms of which won't be released to protect their privacy. Per their prenup, Morris and Hurd agreed that neither will receive alimony and that they will each pay their own legal fees. When ET spoke to Morris last month, she shared her intentions heading into the new year. \"Just, not answering to anyone and not having to protect anyone's feelings but my own and put myself first. And I think that's going to be a really empowering 2024,\" she said. \"A lot of my friends are going through the same thing right now. And all their therapists or psychics have said, '2024, you need to be single.'\" RELATED CONTENT: Video Music News News",

        "content":"Fans of the hit television sitcom “Friends” could be shelling out some cold hard cash for a unique find. Original scripts from the late ’90s-to-early 2000s show were found inside a former staff member’s bedside table — and are now going up for auction. A 60-year-old retired man, who wishes to stay anonymous, said he recently discovered the scripts when he was cleaning out his home in preparation to move. He told Hansons Auctioneers that he almost threw them out, but decided to take them for evaluation at Hansons, an auction house that specializes in jewelry, fine art and collectibles in the U.K. “Funnily enough, I’m not a big ‘Friends’ fan,” he said. “I don’t dislike the show, but I only recently watched the episodes I have the scripts for.” The man worked at Fountain Studios in the Wembley neighborhood of London, England, which is where two popular “Friends” episodes were filmed — “The One with Ross’s Wedding Part I” and “The One with Ross’s Wedding Part II.” Part I, which broadcast in 1998, was the 96th episode of “Friends” and part of the season finale of the show’s fourth season. The episodes are most known for the moment when Ross accidentally says, “I, Ross, take thee Rachel” — instead of his bride-to-be’s name — and when the audience first sees Chandler and Monica’s budding romance. “I used to work in admin support at the studios,” he recalled to Hansons Auctioneers. “I never saw any of the ‘Friends’ cast, but I remember it was madly busy.” The retired London resident said he discovered the scripts in a bin a few weeks after filming, as it was his job to make sure nothing unwanted was left around the studio space. “I wasn’t sure what to do with them, so [I] just put them in my office drawer,” he explained. After leaving the company the following year, he cleared out his desk by putting everything in a cardboard box — a box that ended up in a bedside drawer 25 years later. He said he now wants the scripts to go to a real “Friends” fan as they go up for auction at Hansons Auctioneers on Jan. 12, 2024. Hansons Auctioneers head of operations Amanda Butler said in a press release that the company was “amazed” when they saw the scripts. “Apparently, the cast and crew were ordered to destroy their copies so the ending wouldn’t be leaked,” she explained. “However, these two slipped through the net.” The scripts are estimated to sell for at least $650 — but could always “pivot” and go for much more, the auction house indicated. The bundled auction items include a standby ticket to filming at Fountain Studios on April 2, 1998, and two DVDs of the fourth and fifth seasons as well as a yellow cab sticker, a keyring and a “Friends” London hoodie — allegedly given to the production crew during taping. Those interested in bidding on the items can do so online or in person at Hanson Ross in Royston, England.

Drive summary: 11 plays, 61 yards, 4:01 time of possession A gutsy drive for the Huskies, who needed a touchdown drive to give them some optimism heading into the halftime break. Despite Michigan dominating the game for most of the half, Washington is only down one possession and they get the first ball back in the second half to try and even the score. If you were a Huskies fan panicking after the Wolverines offense looked unstoppable, you'll gladly take this scoreline. WASHINGTON ANSWERS BEFORE THE HALF 🔥 WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A GAME! 😤 #NationalChampionship pic.twitter.com/edJOq2BL5V Second quarter: Huskies defense gets big fourth down stop with 4:43 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Six plays, 29 yards, 3:02 time of possession Could this be the momentum swing the Huskies needed? Michigan went for the juggular with a play on 4th-and-2 in Huskies territory, but the secondary deflected JJ McCarthy's pass to give the offense the ball back at the end of the first half. Second quarter: After the Huskies defense earned a quick three-and-out stop, Washington punts back to the Wolverines with 7:45 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Three plays, three yards, 1:05 time of possession Another missed opportunity for the Huskies, who had a chance to cut into the Wolverines' double-digit lead. Second quarter: Washington turns the ball over on downs. Michigan leads 17-3 with 10:27 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Six plays, 28 yards, 3:01 time of possession Penix Jr finally got something going on the Huskies' third drive of the game, completing two passes for 25 yards to move the ball near Wolverines territory. But Michigan's defense tightened and the Huskies faced a 4th-and-7 on the Wolverines 47-yard line. Instead of a difficult punt, Washington was aggressive and tried for a fourth down conversion. The Huskies' fourth down play created plenty of space for wide receiver Rome Odunze, regarded as one of the best receivers in the country, but Penix Jr threw to the junior's wrong shoulder, so he had to turn his body to track the football and lose momentum. The ball batted helplessly off Odunze's hands and the Huskies turned the ball over. If Penix Jr. had made an accurate throw to Odunze, it could have been a much-needed touchdown for the trailing Huskies. Washington turnover on downs! 😳 Michael Penix Jr. and Rome Odunze can't connect on the deep pass. #NationalChampionship pic.twitter.com/oo3bBV8xgQ Second quarter: Michigan converts 31-yard field goal. Michigan leads 17-3 with 13:28 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Five plays, 65 yards, 1:53 time of possession Michigan began its third possession of the game with a 59-yard run from Blake Corum, the Wolverines' third rush of over 40 yards in the half. The first bit of good news came from the Huskies' response, forcing the Wolverines to settle for a field goal. The Wolverines have scored on all three of its possessions in the game. First quarter: Michigan's Donovan Edwards scores 46-yard rushing touchdown. Michigan leads 14-3 with 2:23 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Four plays, 86 yards, 1:33 time of possession Deja vu for the Huskies, who allowed Edwards to break free for his second rushing touchdown of the game. The junior has already totaled 87 rushing yards and two touchdowns in the first quarter. SO NICE HE HAD TO DO IT TWICE 🔥 Donovan Edwards with his SECOND TD of the night 😱 #NationalChampionship pic.twitter.com/HiaSyzfTLb First quarter: Washington converts 25-yard field goal. Michigan leads 7-3 with 3:56 left in the quarter. Drive summary: 14 plays, 67 yards, 6:18 time of possession The two teams have traded long drives to begin the game, the difference being that the Wolverines punched in a touchdown while the Huskies stalled out in the red zone. Washington had a scare early with running back Dillon Johnson exiting with an injury, but he returned to finish the drive. The Huskies offense was balanced (seven passes, six carries) on a drive that ended in three points. First quarter: Edwards scores 41-yard rushing touchdown. Michigan leads 7-0 with 10:14 left in the quarter. Drive summary: Eight plays, 84 yards, 4:46 time of possession This was an old-fashioned smashmouth possession for the Wolverines, who deployed three different running backs on the drive. Michigan ran on six of eight plays, generating 66 rushing yards and five first downs before Edwards broke free for the game's first touchdown.

        "content":"close Video Jesse Watters: Joe Biden’s plan is ‘don’t campaign and don’t debate’ Fox News host Jesse Watters says Michelle Obama is ‘positioning herself as Plan B’ to President Biden. Fox News host Jesse Watters criticized President Biden and other Democrats for turning Black churches into a \"campaign stop.\" He also warned Biden that former first lady Michelle Obama \"could be running\" and that she seemed to \"forget to mention Joe Biden\" when discussing the Obama administration in a recent interview. MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS SHE IS 'TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN' IN 2024 ELECTION JESSE WATTERS: The Black church has been a cauldron of change in American culture for over a century. From Frederick Douglass, who spent his early days preaching about the abolition of slavery, to Martin Luther King Jr, whose sermons paved the way for the Civil Rights Movement. It was the Black church that galvanized racial progress in this country, and it was the Democratic Party that turned the Black church into a campaign stop. … Biden is trying to throw Trump in prison for the rest of his life; strip his business license, strip him off the ballot, and just call him a combination of Hitler and King George III. And the Obamas think he should go on the attack? I'm afraid to ask what this new level of attack would look like. But if Trump isn't damaged goods by the convention, Michelle Obama's positioning herself as Plan B. … Michelle Obama is talking about war, talking about artificial intelligence. This woman isn't just a fruit juice tycoon. She could be running. … CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Did she just forget to mention Joe Biden? Michelle, as your husband said, you didn't build that. But if I were Joe Biden, I don't know who I'd fear more – Trump or her. Video This article was written by Fox News staff.",

El precio del litro de gasolina regular pasará de 25 pesos cubanos (0,20 centavos de dólar) a 132 (1,10 dólares) REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Además del aumento en los combustibles se anunció un incremento en la tarifa de electricidad del 25% para el sector de mayor consumo a partir del 1 de marzo.

El objetivo es buscar el ahorro”, señaló de la O Levy. También habrá un aumento en la factura de gas licuado . Combustible “más barato del mundo” El gobierno, que subvenciona casi el total de los servicios y bienes básicos que consumen los cubanos, esbozó en diciembre un grupo de medidas para revertir la crisis económica que enfrenta el país, por los efectos de la pandemia, el recrudecimiento de las sanciones impuestas por Washington y las distorsiones internas de su economía. De acuerdo con estimaciones oficiales , la economía cubana se contrajo hasta un 2% en 2023, mientras que la inflación cerró en un 30% , una cifra menor a la de 39% registrada en 2022. Ese mismo mes, el gobierno aprobó una ampliación del presupuesto público de 2023 para aumentar un 44% el déficit fiscal, que equivale a cerca del 15% del PIB , según analistas. Además del aumento en los combustibles se anunció un incremento en la tarifa de electricidad del 25% para el sector de mayor consumo a partir del 1 de marzo (EFE/Yander Zamora) A finales de diciembre el gobierno admitió que era insostenible continuar vendiendo el combustible a precios “subsidiados”. “El país no puede mantener el precio del combustible, que es el más barato del mundo cuando lo comparas con los precios de los otros países”, dijo el ministro de Economía , Alejandro Gil . Para el economista Omar Everleny Pérez estas medidas golpearán al ciudadano de a pie . “Si te comparas con el mundo, que es como ellos (el gobierno) quieren compararse siempre, la gasolina es muy barata, pero si te comparas con el salario del país que pagas, la gasolina es muy cara”. “Si el dueño del carro transporta población , va a subir el pasaje y termina afectando a la población”, apunta. El ministro de Economía de Cuba, Alejandro Gil Fernández (EFE/Yander Zamora) De acuerdo con cifras oficiales , unos 600.000 automóviles de combustión circulaban en 2022 en Cuba , donde viven 11,1 millones de personas. Mientras que el transporte público es cada vez más limitado por la falta de combustible, neumáticos y piezas de recambio . Cuba afronta una crónica crisis de combustibles, agravada en abril de 2023, cuando Díaz-Canel la atribuyó al incumplimiento de compromisos de los países que suministran el crudo a la isla porque enfrentan “una situación energética compleja”. Venezuela , principal proveedor de crudo de Cuba, entrega a la isla 56.000 barriles diarios, mientras que México y Rusia han contribuido durante el último año a atenuar el severo déficit de la isla.

        "description":"Durham Mayor Leonardo Williams presented his \"Master Plan\" for the city, which also focuses on other key priorities like affordable housing and community development.",
        "content":"DURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) – A new mayor and new priorities in Durham. On Monday afternoon, Mayor Leonardo Williams announced his vision for the city’s future, focusing on job opportunities, safety and economic growth. “They are going to be robust,” Williams said. “They are going to be ambitious. But that is how we define them as being also Durham.” Williams presented his “Master Plan” for the city, which also focuses on other key priorities like affordable housing and community development. He cites community, economic and workforce development as his focus areas. “Durham has the opportunities,” Williams said. “We have the people. We have to bridge the gap to create that opportunity and access.” Williams says he plans to create a citywide apprenticeship program that could provide work opportunities for teens, while focusing on housing security for those struggling to find quality shelter. He said those issues of housing and access to jobs go hand-in-hand with crime. This comes as juvenile criminal offenses skyrocketed by over 300% through the third quarter of last year. CBS 17 asked Williams how he plans to deal with a significant shortage of Durham police officers. “Crime prevention when it comes to a law enforcement perspective, how do you plan to tackle that?” “We have to come together as a council. We have to get on the same page about how that’s going to happen,” Williams said. “We know that at the bottom of crime are root-cause issues,” Durham Mayor Pro Tempore Mark-Anthony Middleton said after Monday’s announcement. Over the next 100 days, Williams wants to work with his council members on enhancing safety, expanding commerce and building local workforce talent. “There’s a mutual respect for the community of Durham,” Williams said. “We’re all ultra-committed to Durham.” The mayor will establish industry-specific advisory councils within the coming weeks.",

        "content":"Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore are speaking out after Vili Fualaau slammed their new movie May December . Vili , 40, recently called the new Todd Haynes -directed movie a “ripoff” of his real-life relationship with the late Mary Kay Letourneau . In May December , Charles Melton ‘s character Joe was 13 when he was seduced by Julianne ‘s 36-year-old character. Vili was 12 when 34-year-old Mary Kay first victimized him in 1996. She later pleaded guilty to two counts of child rape. Vili said that he was “offended” by the movie and slammed everyone involved for not reaching out to him for feedback. Now, Natalie and Julianne are addressing Vili ‘s criticism. “I’m so sorry to here that. It’s not based on them,” Natalie told Entertainment Tonight at the 2024 Golden Globes . “Obviously, their story influenced the culture that we all grew up in and influenced the idea. But it’s fictional characters that are really brought to life by Julianne Moore and Charles Melton so beautifully. It’s its own story, it’s not meant to be a biopic.” Julianne then insisted that Todd “was always very clear when we were working on this movie that this was an original story, this was a story about these characters.” “This was our document,” Julianne continued. “We created these characters from the page and together.” In another recent interview, Charles opened up about preparing for the role . May December is available for streaming on Netflix now.",

        "content":"Nvidia came ready for CES 2024. Alongside the expected focus on its hot-ticket items including AI, robotics and tools for professionals, it announced The RTX 40 Super graphics card series . But there's more. Its G-Sync variable refresh rate technology and GeForce Now streaming service are also getting some updates. In a move that surprised me in a good way, Nvidia is planning to add cloud based G-Sync support to its GeForce Now Ultimate Tier . This will allow variable refresh rate monitors to match the FPS of games streamed via Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Jacob Ridley, our man in Vegas, saw it demonstrated in real time and says it definitely worked well. He adds that Nvidia said it will work on any variable refresh rate screen. When used in conjunction with Nvidia's Reflex technology, Ultimate Tier members will be able to experience tear-free gaming on just about any capable device, mimicking gameplay as though you are playing the title locally. We'd have to see how it performs outside of a controlled environment but it does indeed sound like a promising improvement for GeForce Now. In addition, Nvidia is expanding Reflex support to 4K titles in 60 fps and 120 fps modes. This promises smooth gameplay with improved latency and minimal stuttering. That sounds pretty good to me. There's also a new 1440p mode for Android phone and tablet users. The right titles (and the right display) should result in some very pretty visuals. GeForce Now itself is set to receive new membership options. Currently, a GeForce Now Priority one month membership sets you back $10 a month, while a month of Ultimate membership costs a not insignificant $20. The latter is a bit on the steep side for anyone looking to give it a try. Best AIO cooler for CPUs : Keep your chip chill. Best air cooler for CPUs : Classic, quiet cooling. With that in mind, Nvidia is introducing one-day passes, with a Priority tier membership setting you back $4 and an Ultimate tier pass costing a palatable $8. So, if you're looking to see what RTX 4080-based cloud gaming with G-Sync support at up to 4K looks like on your device of choice, a $8 one-day pass will be a great way to check out the best of what GeForce Now has to offer. Fans of Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 will be pleased to note that both are coming to GeForce Now . If you don't have the budget or inclination to upgrade your graphics card (or your whole PC for that matter), a one day pass for a few bucks will be a good way to see if the service is something you would consider using long term. _____________________________________ PC Gamer's CES 2024 coverage is being published in association with Asus Republic of Gamers.",

        "content":"Apple TV+ is about to drop a slew of new prestige TV series on us, including one that cost almost $300 million. That’s a lot of money for a streamer that relatively few people are watching, no? Apple’s pricey new release comes from Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, who’ve brought — the third series in their World War II trilogy (which also includes HBO’s and — to . Under the direction of Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, the iPhone maker’s streamer has also teed up a flurry of additional projects that will no doubt make critics swoon — including another pricey series about fashion icons Coco Chanel and Christian Dior, with Ben Mendelsohn starring as the latter. Among other imminent Apple releases, we’re also getting , a thriller about the hunt for President Abraham Lincoln’s assassin; , a star-studded about socialites; as well as , a conspiracy-based adventure set in space. Shows like these are unbelievably expensive to make, gorgeous to look at, and tend to draw fawning press coverage — the end result of which is that subscribers are convinced to keep paying $9.99/month for Apple TV+. That’s the idea, at any rate. But how long can this go on? That’s the question that Matt Belloni — a former editor of who now writes for Puck News — thinks that 2024 will likely go a long way toward answering for Apple. “How long can this continue? Forever, of course, given Apple’s deep pockets,” Belloni writes in his latest newsletter. “After all, revenue from its ‘services’ unit that includes Apple TV+ has grown (though that growth is mostly from its App Store and iCloud features). Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the “But Apple will likely need to pick a lane soon on originals: Either ramp up the volume and/or buy or license a library of content to compete for real … or pull way back on scripted content, focus instead on high-value live sports or, potentially, even throw in the towel on the Hollywood experiment entirely. Long-term, sky-high content costs and low subscribers/engagement isn’t the answer.” For the sake of the streaming TV landscape, I hope he’s wrong. Yes, I understand that Apple was by less than 1 percent of connected TV viewers in November, according to the most recent Nielsen Gauge report. But let’s try to keep some perspective here. Apple TV+ will be five years old this year. Netflix debuted , its first stab at original programming, 15 years after the streamer’s launch in 1998. I write these words as a happy subscriber to Apple TV+ (along with most of the other major streamers). A world where Netflix wins, and every smaller streamer either gobbles up rivals or just gets out of the game entirely is not a very interesting one. Apple, for better or worse, has brought a lot of interesting content to our TVs, iPhones, and iPads. Check out the link below for some of the best Apple TV+ shows to watch right now — and, who knows, is reportedly seriously missing his character, so maybe the long-hoped-for Season 4/spinoff/or whatever becomes a reality soon.",

        "content":"Loading... Loading... In a blog post, on Monday, ChatGPT -parent OpenAI made a public response to a lawsuit filed by The New York Times Co. NYT , stating that the newspaper’s accusations do not fully represent the usage of Times data by OpenAI. What Happened: OpenAI responded to the lawsuit by the New York Times, accusing ChatGPT-parent of using copyrighted articles to train their popular chatbot and other AI features. The Times also reportedly provided examples where the chatbot reproduced sections of text almost verbatim from its articles, reported Bloomberg. In response, OpenAI stated that this type of “regurgitation” is a “rare bug” that they are actively working to eliminate. They further suggested that the Times may have “deliberately manipulated prompts” and “cherry-picked their examples from multiple attempts”. \"We regard The New York Times' lawsuit to be without merit. Still, we are hopeful for a constructive partnership with The New York Times and respect its long history, which includes reporting the first working neural network over 60 years ago and championing First Amendment freedoms,\" the company said in the blog post. OpenAI’s chatbot, like other generative AI technologies, is fueled by large language models that ingest vast amounts of digital text from various sources. Even though using online data has been standard practice, recent debates have emerged concerning compensation for content creators whose work contributes to these technologies. See Also: From Recommending Tesla Cars To Generating Code, Chevrolet's ChatGPT-Powered Chatbot Gets Taken For A Ride Why It Matters: This lawsuit is not the first of its kind. In December last year, a group of 11 nonfiction authors , including Pulitzer Prize winners, joined a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft Corporation MSFT accusing the companies of using their writings without permission for training AI programs. Meanwhile, OpenAI has been in discussions with various publishers to license their content amidst the copyright lawsuit filed by the New York Times. Tom Rubin , chief of intellectual property and content at OpenAI, previously described these negotiations as positive and progressing well.

        "content":"Intel's performance-enhancing Application Optimizer software is set to be supported on some 12th and 13th Gen processors, in a complete reverse of the company's previous position on the matter. Application Optimizer (APO) is a piece of software built into Intel's drivers that helps optimise processor performance in supported games. It has the potential to be quite handy, too. Intel cites up to double digit performance gains with APO enabled in Metro Exodus, for example. Initially only supported on the 14900K /KF and 14700K /KF, there had been calls on Intel to open up the APO software—which is built into Intel's Dynamic Tuning Technology (DTT) driver—to older 12th and 13th Gen chips that utilise the same sort of hybrid architecture as the 14th Gen. Intel had resoundingly shot down this idea to Hardware Unboxed , after the YouTube channel's own testing of the feature, when it quoted Intel as saying it \"has no plans to support prior generation products with Application Optimization.\" Well, that's all changed at CES 2024. Just briefly mentioned during a presentation, Intel said it plans to support some prior generation products with Application Optimization—at least some 12th and 13th Gen K-series processors. It makes sense to open the feature up where possible. APO appears to help increase utilisation of the low-power E-cores within Intel's hybrid architectures, and these are found on most chips since the 12th Gen. Best CPU for gaming : The top chips from Intel and AMD. Best gaming motherboard : The right boards. Best graphics card : Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits. Best SSD for gaming : Get into the game ahead of the rest. Intel says it'll have 14 games in total validated for APO by the next release, though that's across both desktop and mobile processors that support APO. Intel's new 14th Gen HX-series mobile processors will also support the feature, and at least eight games are optimised for the HX-series. I'm not quite sure if that means optimisation for desktop as well or if the supported titles are processor specific. I'm thinking it's more likely the latter. To my knowledge the list of supported games now includes Rainbow Six: Siege, Metro Exodus, Guardians of the Galaxy, F1 22, Strange Brigade, World War Z, Dirt 5, and World of Warcraft . There's no master list of what's supported right now, however. For that reason, APO remains a pretty niche application, but here's hoping that list grows over the next 12 months. As for when you'll be able to enable it on those older chips, Intel hasn't said when that will happen exactly, but presumably support will come with a new version of the DTT drivers. Keep an eye out for that. Just be warned, the installation process wasn't easy for APO. That's another thing I hope improves with future updates. But I'm not turning my nose up at a free performance uplift. I just hope APO is able to materialise into something genuinely useful with time.",

DES MOINES, IA - With one week until the Iowa caucuses kick off the Republican presidential nominating calendar, Nikki Haley is a candidate on the rise. But with her rise in the polls comes more scrutiny for Haley, and more incoming fire from her rivals for the GOP nomination and from President Biden. On Monday, at a Fox News town hall hosted by \"Special Report\" chief political anchor Bret Baier and \"The Story\" executive editor and anchor Martha MacCallum, the former South Carolina governor who served as ambassador to the United Nations in former President Donald Trump's administration fired back. Among her targets, Biden, who hours earlier knocked her for failing to mention slavery when answering a question about the causes of the Civil War. WHAT NIKKI HALEY SAID AT HER FOX NEWS TOWN HALL IN IOWA Former ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, joins Fox News' Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum for a town hall, on Jan. 8, 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) \"Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War,\" the president said hours earlier, as he gave a speech in Haley's hometown. Biden spoke at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, a historic Black church where nine parishioners were killed in a horrific 2015 shooting. \"Mother Emanuel Church is a sacred place,\" Haley said when asked to respond. \"For Biden to show up there and give a political speech is offensive in itself. And Haley stressed that \"I don't need someone who palled around with segregationists in the '70s and has said racist comments all the way through his career lecturing me or anyone in South Carolina about what it means to have racism, slavery, or anything related to the Civil War.\" Biden came under criticism as he ran for the White House during the 2020 presidential cycle for speaking positively about two segregationist senators he had years earlier worked with in the Senate, as he noted that there was at least \"some civility\" in the chamber. GREAT EXPECTATIONS: THE PRESSURE'S ON FOR TRUMP, DESANTIS, AND HALEY TO PERFORM IN IOWA'S CAUCUSES Haley also argued that \"Biden should be fired\" after the Pentagon failed to disclose that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had been hospitalized for elective surgery, leaving the president in the dark for a couple of days. \"This is unbelievable that we have a situation like this.\" \"I have a problem with the fact that Biden is not talking to his secretary of Defense every single day anyway,\" Haley stressed. Video Haley has soared in recent months, thanks in part to her well-regarded performances in the first three Republican presidential primary debates. Over the past month she hs caught up with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the latest Iowa polls and in national surveys, for a distant second place behind Trump, who remains the commanding front-runner for the nomination as he makes his third straight White House run. And Haley has surged to second place and narrowed the gap with Trump in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary and votes second - just eight days after Iowa. FIRST ON FOX: HALEY FUNDRAISING SOARS THE PAST THREE MONTHS Trump and his political allies have increasingly taken aim at Haley in recent weeks. The Trump campaign and an aligned super PAC are running new ads that blast Haley over the combustible issue of border security and illegal immigration. \"Haley even opposed Trump’s wall and Haley repeatedly pushed amnesty for illegals,\" the narrator in a new spot that started running Monday claimed. \"Nikki Haley – too weak, too liberal, to fix the border.\" And the Trump campaign blasted out emails during the Fox News town hall targeting Haley over immigration, taxes and the support she's received from some top dollar Wall Street donors. Former ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a 2024 Republican presidential candidate, speaks with a member of the audience at a Fox News town hall, on Jan. 8, 2023 in Des Moines, Iowa (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Firing back, Haley argued \"just because President Trump says something doesn't make it true.\" \"He’s lying about it,\" she stressed. \"And I’ll tell you the reason he’s lying about it is because he’s taking snippets of things I said. I said you shouldn't just do the border wall. You have to do more than that. That's what I said.\" But Haley and her campaign take the increased attacks as a sign that Trump's increasingly concerned about her upward mobility in the polls. \"I appreciate all the attention President Trump is giving me. It is quite sweet and thoughtful of him,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump and his allies aren't the only ones taking aim at Haley. DeSantis and two super PACs aligned with his campaign are also training their fire on Haley. A recent ad claims that Haley was inspired by former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who's a popular target for Republicans.

        "content":"Former President Trump on Monday attacked former Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) in an interview, labeling them as “far worse” than all Democrats. In his interview with Lou Dobbs that aired Monday, Trump repeated the false claim that the Jan. 6 committee deleted all of its evidence and railed against the committee, its members and the hearings. “They’ve taken that hearing, which was a total sham, with all Democrats and two Republicans that were far worse than any Democrat that ever lived,” Trump said, referring to Cheney and Kinzinger. “Two very sick Republicans.” Cheney and Kinzinger – two Republicans who represent the resistance to Trump’s grip on the party – have been frequent targets of the former president. They were part of the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol, which referred to the DOJ four criminal charges against Trump related to the attack on the capitol and his refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election. Their conclusions and evidence they gathered throughout the lengthy investigation . Trump, in the interview, then took aim at Cheney, who lost her primary reelection bid in 2022 after she frequently shot down claims of a stolen election and talked at length about the threat she thought Trump posed to democracy. “I mean, Liz Cheney’s a sick person. I was responsible for her defeat in her state where she couldn’t be beaten and by the time we finished she got the lowest vote in the history of politics,” Trump said.",

        "description":"“You know Donald Trump is feeling good when he moves into Triumph the Insult Comic President mode, early in a speech,” reports Racket News’ Matt Taibbi.",
        "content":"“You know Donald Trump is feeling good when he moves into Triumph the Insult Comic President mode, early in a speech,” reports Racket News’ Matt Taibbi . “In Iowa Friday, ten days before Americans officially start voting for the man, Trump was a violin short of Henny Youngman,” with opening jokes on rivals Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. Then his new-ish “Crooked Joe searching for the exit” schtick, which is “funny. It just is. In part this is because Biden is funny, a physical comedy wonder, unfortunately just not on purpose.” Other times, he had “a strong late-stage Lenny Bruce vibe” plus “homages to Richard Pryor” as well as “Milton Berle, Dangerfield . . . In a few places he even drifted tonewise toward Louis C.K.” In all, “Trump and his opponents probably share responsibility for turning American politics into a joke, but only one of the two parties is trying to tell us it’s not funny. And ‘that’s not funny’ is a losing political slogan.” You can’t visit Dachau, “the first concentration camp Hitler established,” without shuddering “in terror when walking into the gas chamber and then to the adjacent crematoria,” meditates John Nagl at The Hill . Yet “the horrors documented” there “are happening again”: “Russia’s unjust invasion of Ukraine has been followed by the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and the rape, torture and murder of Ukrainian civilians in a tragic echo of the Nazi techniques honed at Dachau.” But “America is wavering in its support for Ukraine” — “a small country fighting fascism in Europe.” Members of “Congress should visit Dachau in January” to “see what fascism looks like, and then gaze east, while they decide whether they will let it happen again.” The Biden administration just quietly changed the rules “to give state and local governments more time to spend their American Rescue Plan Act” funds, gripes Reason’s Eric Boehm . That law stipulated “governments had to ‘obligate’ those funds — in other words, attach them to a specific project — by the end of this year,” but the new rule offers “several ways for the recipients to hoard their federal bailout funds without committing them to specific projects,” though “many of the projects already funded through ARPA seem to have little to do with pandemic relief.” “The federal government considers the pandemic to be over.” But “why should that stop the federal gravy train from rolling along?” With Donald Trump’s huge lead heading into the Iowa caucuses, “the big question is what is going to happen with the remaining Trump opponents,” argues Mark Penn at Fox News . If Ron DeSantis “finishes a strong second, he could revive his campaign; if he finishes third, I would expect him to drop out.” Nikki Haley “was never expected to do well in Iowa,” yet “the polls place her in a close third place and that kind of finish would set her up for New Hampshire.” Meanwhile, “Democrats have called off the Democratic caucus” — it’s “part of their ‘threat to democracy’ campaign which they seem to advance by eliminating actual democracy.” And Rep. Dean Phillips “has been removed from the ballots in Florida and North Carolina even though he is not accused of leading an insurrection” President Biden is kicking off his campaign “with two speeches designed only to divide voters and scare them,” fume the Washington Examiner’s editors . One marked the Jan. 6 riot anniversary, the other at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, where nine people were fatally shot in 2015. His theme is “that Trump is the head of a white supremacist movement seeking to overthrow the United States government violently.” Yet such “rantings” are those of a “divisive demagogue, someone who might also say that [his] political opponents would put black people ‘back in chains’ ” — as Biden said of Mitt Romney in 2012. Yes, Trump is “unfit for office.” But that doesn’t mean he’s “leading a violent white supremacist movement.” That’s “pure hysteria.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board",

        "content":"Sony is now on its fifth year of showing off its upcoming electric car in its CES press conferences, which we will be named AFEELA and is planned hit the market in 2026. This year, the press conference focused on Sony’s software plans for its new vehicle – along with a heap of the latest buzzwords, mostly to do with AI. To recap, the AFEELA concept was to have 400kW (536hp) dual-motor all-wheel-drive, 0-100km/h (0-62mph) in 4.8 seconds, and a top speed of 240km/h (149mph). As far as we’re aware, those are still the specs Sony is aiming for. We still have no information on price or battery size, but we do have two more years until this car hits the road, so price will surely come later. Sony is focusing on its electronics expertise by highlighting the car’s sensing and infotainment systems. Like just about every electric car coming out these days, the AFEELA will have a wide array of sensors for potential autonomous driving tasks. And inside the car, Sony thinks that it can provide better infotainment due to its experience in consumer entertainment. It wants to implement continuous over-the-air software updates, and has shown interior photos of large displays in both the front and back seats, seeming to indicate that there could be PS5-level performance available for gaming tasks in the car (potentially giving Tesla a run for its money in the market). But lest we think this is just an electronics company putting up a pipe dream of a product to get more eyes on their CES conference presentation, Sony has taken steps to show that its serious about building this car. It has already to form Sony Honda Mobility, Inc. Interestingly, Sony got top billing in the partnership, rather than Honda – perhaps a reflection of the Japanese automaker’s hesitance towards anything EV. In today’s press conference, Sony brought Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe on stage to talk about the partnership and how mobility is going through a “once in 100 year” transformation” – though in his speech, he didn’t use the word “electric” once. Then Yasuhide Mizuno, CEO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc., came on stage to talk about the in-car software experience. He started off by showing the car’s software-defined nature by… driving the car onto stage with a PS5 controller. But don’t get too excited – he stated that this was “for the purpose of stage showcase only.” Nevertheless, what the demonstration shows is that cars are becoming more defined by software, rather than hardware. With software having deep control of vehicle functions, over-the-air updates can change several characteristics of the drive experience, and can improve vehicles over time. But it also means that , perhaps moreso than vehicles used to experienced before they were so software-driven. Sony says that the software-defined nature of the car will turn the car into a “digital playground” for creators to invent new in-car experiences. It showed an example game that renders a vehicle in a mock world alongside escaped godzilla-like monsters, which you can get points for catching. It also said it wants to “foster a creative community between users and creators” with “access to vehicle data” in order to “realize unique ideas.” Which frankly sounds a little Orwellian, not particularly helped by the fact that it then brought on stage to announce a partnership that… had something (?) to do with AI. Frankly, I blanked out a bit during this part, because I’ve heard enough AI buzzwords this year. And then Sony closed up the press conference, without any new details on price, battery, the SUV version which appeared two years ago and hasn’t since, or a reiteration of the previously-announced 2026 availability. Here’s a replay of the full conference (AFEELA presentation starts at 34:23): When Sony originally , we thought it was a bit crazy that seemed to be showing off concept EVs now. We’ve seen lots of concept EVs over the years, with varying levels of seriousness. Sony’s could have been another one of the less-serious ones… but it wasn’t. It looked relatively refined and reasonable and didn’t make as many as some others might have. At the time, we thought there was actually a decent chance this might happen, and each year since then, Sony has inched a step closer to actually releasing this car. Between , some , an (which now has only been shown once, and been absent two years straight), its , and a (with reasonable timeline – at least 7 years after development started on the car), there’s more progress each time we hear about this car. Of course – by the time this car comes out, they will have talked about it in straight CES conferences, if this trend holds. Sure building a car is a huge change for a company that has focused on consumer electronics, but at this point they’re milking this concept for all its worth. I know I just praised them for taking their time with it, and that praise holds, and I’m glad we’re getting updates and all… but that’s still a lot of press conferences for one car. In contrast, another consumer electronics company that has been rumored to be developing a car, Apple, has never talked about it publicly. Personally I’ve always thought that getting into cars would be an unwise move for Apple (recall Tim Cook’s famous “ ” presentation) and am therefore skeptical that this will ever happen, but it’s definitely a contrast in press strategy from Sony’s approach. And that was perhaps particularly apparent this year. While each previous presentation has included meaningful new information beyond the previous year’s, this one seemed like fluff to me. The tech buzzword of the last year has been AI, and every company wants to somehow attach their image to that of AI, hoping to do as well as, say, . So I’m a little disappointed in this specific press conference. Going into it, I didn’t expect much, since Sony has already shown off the car so many times and, frankly, it doesn’t need to show it off seven times before it comes out. But the AI stuff just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It’s a car, tell us how it’s going to function as a car. Don’t just blow buzzwords at us. Yes, being software-defined is neat and enables new experiences, and can even make a car better over time (I’ve seen this with my , which is a better car today than it was when I first took delivery). It potentially unshackles us from the previous yearly update cycle which has encouraged overconsumption of vehicles for more than half a century. But hunting dinosaurs in your car and letting creators spy on your vehicle data is just weird. So lets focus on the car, instead of (and this is coming from a person who plays entirely too many video games). Regardless, we’re still really looking forward to trying this thing out when it’s ready. Hopefully next year – since that will be Sony’s last opportunity before its planned . and subscribe to the .
