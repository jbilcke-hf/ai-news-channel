      "description": "TCL is bringing a feature-rich lineup of new TVs to market, with a stunning 115-in mini-LED model that's a powerful OLED contender.",
      "content": "Mirroring other TV makers, TCL is pushing into new innovative bounds with the introduction of a more advanced AI system-on-chip made in-house to deliver powerful on-screen upscaling and TV UX improvements. It's all apart of the magic that is CES 2024 , where AI is everywhere . The three tiers of TCL chips include the base AIPQ, which for the first time ever will be on its S551G 4K TV, the AIPQ Pro, as found on its QM7 and QM8 models, and the AIPQ Ultra, which will only be on the high-class QM891G QD Mini LED, a stunner of a 115-inch TV. TCL pushed into new territory in 2023, giving Samsung a run for its money with as much as a 16.3% growth over the previous year, and it's vying for a similar win come 2024 with exciting new releases in its Q Class series lineup, such as the aforementioned QM891G QD Mini LED TV. Enhancements on the QLED side are also plentiful, with the QM651G-Pro gaining some serious new features thanks to its sparkly new AIPQ processor. Major quality of life upgrades include Full Array Local Dimming (FALD), hands-free voice control, and even a backlit remote. TCL is making massive strides with its 4K TV options, too, highlighting the S551G as a major new addition with improved LED backlighting, the inclusion of HDR Pro+ support, and a bezel-less design for exceptional qualities at every angle. QM751G The most budget option among TCL's newest mini LED lineup is the QM751G , a robust, IMAX Enhanced panel with a 120Hz refresh rate (144Hz VRR), AMD FreeSync Premium, a 2.1 channel speaker, and HDR Ultra support with Dolby Vision IQ. Like most of TCL's newest models, the QM751G boasts similar gains in brightness and contrast ratios, taking home as much as 2,000 nits of peak brightness in tandem with more than 1,300 dimming zones, and a color gamut of 95% on the DCI-P3 scale. A new 98-inch model should give the QM751 mini LED incredible legs for those looking for a quality TV at a massive scale. Here are the QM751G sizes TCL has announced so far: 55, 65, 75 and 98 inches. QM851G Leveraging the TCL AIPQ Pro processor is the QM851G Mini LED , a 120Hz display with some incredible enhancements like a 2.1.2 channel speaker system, 97% color gamut on the DCI-P3 spectrum, more than 5,000 dimming zones, and up to as much as 5,000 nits of peak brightness. Like its much larger 115-inch companion, the QM851G will be a next gen TV with an ATSC 3.0 digital tuner, WiFI 6, and an anti-glare screen. It will support 240 VRR via Game Accelerator and AMD FreeSync Premium so gamers aren't left in the dust. Here are the QM851G sizes TCL has announced so far: 65, 75, 85 and 98 inches QM891G Arguably the most exciting entries among TCL's new lineup is the gorgeous 115-inch QM891G Mini LED , which leverages the firm's most powerful chipset, the AIPQ Ultra. It can hit a peak brightness of more than 5,000 nits, has 20,000 dimming zones for impeccable contrast, and has as much as 98% coverage of DCI-P3 color. A 6.2.2 channel speaker will certainly keep the room well-occupied with sound, aided by a built-in subwoofer and up-firing Atmos speakers. But what about gaming? Well, the QM891G Mini LED comes equipped with a 120Hz refresh rate that can hit 240Hz VRR via Game Accelerator, while AMD FreeSync Premium ensures there's little if any screen tearing amidst the high-paced action. The inclusion of ATSC 3.0 makes this a true next-gen TV, sporting additions like an Anti-Glare screen, WiFi 6, and Motion Rate 480 for the most well-rounded display under the TCL banner. The TCL QM891G Mini LED will only be available in a 115-inch model. Q651G-Pro QLED At the highest tier of TCL's QLED lineup is the Q651G-Pro , a stunning quantum dot model with tons of enhanced features, highlighted by gaming upgrades such as a 120Hz refresh rate that can be bumped to 240Hz VRR through the new Game Accelerator on the Enhanced 85-in model. New inclusions like hands-free voice control, full array local dimming (FALD), and the bezel-less design gift the Q651G-Pro an exceptional leg up over competitors. A reworked panel that has high brightness pro LED backlighting is also a welcome new addition, gifting this QLED as much as 33% higher peak brightness. Here are the Q651G-Pro QLED sizes TCL has announced so far: 55, 65, 75, and 85 inches (Enhanced) Q651G QLED Although it might drop the Pro from its name, the Q651G QLED is hardly less impressive. Emulating its more premium brethren, the Q651G also will have more pronounced LED backlighting for nearly 28% brighter ratios over its predecessor. It also features a bezel-less design and comes in an all-new 98-inch model. Both the 85- and 98-inch options will have advanced gaming features, like a 120Hz refresh rate that can be increased to 240Hz via VRR. Models under the 85-inch designation will have 120Hz VRR gaming instead, in tandem with Motion Rate 240 via MEMC and newly enhanced software features thanks to the included AIPQ processor. Standard additional features will also be present on the Q651G QLED, like Dolby Atmos support, DTS Virtual: X, and ALLM. The 6 series remains a staple of the brand, ranked as among the best TCL TVs this previous year and 2024 may well be no different. Here are the Q651G QLED sizes TCL has announced so far: 43, 50, 55, 65 and 75 as well as Enhanced 85- and 98-inch versions. S551G It wouldn't be a TCL TV roundup without a product geared specifically for the budget 4K TV crowd. That's where the S551G 4K TV shines brightest, soaking in some much-needed enhancements over predecessors, like HDR Pro+, a FullView 360 Metal Bezel-less design, and the sparkly new AIPQ processor. Thanks to these new features, the S551G can now claim a more feature-rich backbone with the inclusion of TV as Center Mode, Hospitality Mode, Enhanced Dialog, and Custom Install Capability. It will also come equipped with standard features, like Motion Rate 240 via MEMC, Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual: X, and ALLM. Here are the QM891G sizes TCL has announced so far: 43, 50, 55, 65, 75 and 85 inches. Check out our CES 2024 hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

      "content": "After being announced in June last year at WWDC 2023, . At first, the name chosen by Apple puzzled some people since a non-Pro Apple Vision has never been announced. But it seems that the company wants to be ready for when that happens someday, as it has been removing the “Pro” label from Apple Vision mentions in the latest beta of iOS 17. iOS is ready for a non-Pro Apple Vision As noticed by in the , several strings that mentioned Apple Vision Pro have been updated with just “Apple Vision” instead. For example, strings related to the App Store previously read “Mac, iPad, and Apple Vision Pro Apps”. Now, the same string reads “Mac, iPad, and Apple Vision Apps”. Of course, this doesn’t mean much at this point, but it does show that Apple wants to be ready for when it decides to announce a cheaper version of the Apple Vision Pro. On , the navigation tab also lists the product as “Vision” instead of Vision Pro. Even before the official announcement of the Apple Vision Pro, there were rumors that Apple was also working on a less expensive version since the Pro version starts at $3,499. It’s still unclear how exactly these two versions will differ, but potentially the cheaper Apple Vision will use less premium materials and won’t have some features like EyeSight. According to , . However, given that Apple Vision Pro is only now being launched in the US and will only arrive in a few other countries by the end of the year, a more affordable Apple Vision is unlikely to be introduced before 2025 at the earliest.

      "content": "Sony is previewing designed to let users edit and shape 3D models while wearing a virtual reality headset. The company showed off the headset along with a unique pair of controllers today during a presentation at CES 2024. The headset, which is powered by the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platform and outfitted with 4K OLED displays, isn’t primarily for gamers like PlayStation VR. Instead, Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said that this new headset is made for professionals who work with 3D, allowing wearers to expand the “creation space by overlaying virtual objects into physical spaces,” The demo showed users manipulating virtual objects while using two controllers: a ring and a pointer that fits into your hand. Meanwhile, the front part of the headset flips up to let users switch between virtual and physical spaces. Sony says its “proprietary rendering technology” allows for “real-time, high-definition and realistic rendering of textures of 3D objects and facial expressions of human characters.” 1 / 6 1 / 6 “With seamless access to virtual objects, creators can work in real space with an immersive development experience,” Yoshida said. Sony previously made a “ ” that allowed users to see digital objects in 3D using face- and eye-tracking. That tech here is obviously a lot different, but it seems to be designed for the same type of pro content creator. Sony says the new system will come out later this year, but there’s no word on pricing yet. It might have some competition with the Apple Vision Pro, though, . /",

      "description": "A new ad for the Vision Pro has landed just hours after Apple announced that the mixed-reality headset will officially launch early next month.",
      "content": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset — the company’s most significant product launch since the Apple Watch in 2015 — is almost here. The eagerly awaited mixed-reality goggles will be available to preorder in the U.S. from January 19 ahead of an official launch on February 2, the tech giant revealed on Monday . Other countries are expected to follow soon. Recommended Videos Now that the announcement has been made, expect Apple to see a new wave of Vision Pro ads appearing across various media as the company seeks to raise the profile of the device — and increase the hype — ahead of next month’s launch. Related Qualcomm and Samsung are teaming up to fight Apple’s Vision Pro Apple is about to begin mass shipments of Vision Pro, report says Apple Vision Pro launch nears as staff get special training In fact, Apple’s first ad has just dropped, and you can watch it below: The 39-second ad, shared on the tech giant’s YouTube channel, features famous movie and cartoon characters putting on various head-based devices and accessories, and ends with a clip of a woman putting on the Vision Pro. The ad ends with the tagline, “Get Ready.” But just how many people will be “getting ready” to fork out $3,499 for the pricey device remains to be seen. That kind of money could alternatively get you a high-end PC or a decent vacation, among many other things . But Apple is hoping that it’ll be able to persuade enough people that the mixed-reality headset is a game changer in the form of a “revolutionary spatial computer that transforms how people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, and enjoy entertainment,” as it said today. Some interested folks whose budget can’t stretch that far but who would like to stay within the Apple ecosystem will no doubt be hoping for a more wallet-friendly version of the Vision Pro. Apple is rumored to be working on such a device , though there’s no official word on when it might be released. Editors' Recommendations Apple’s Vision Pro headset officially launches on February 2 Spatial computing went public this year, but the true test is ahead Apple ramping up production of Vision Pro ahead of sooner-than-expected launch Will the Vision Pro replace the Mac? Why Apple will have to tread carefully The Vision Pro is the wrong product at the wrong time for Apple",

      "description": "Significant inventory problems and technology that works \"well enough\" could push the release of an AirTag follow-up to 2025.",
      "content": "Apple is in no hurry to release its next-generation AirTag , according to a new report. The tech giant has decided to hold off on a 2024 AirTag 2 launch due to a backlog of available inventory, among other issues, Bloomberg’s Apple reporter Mark Gurman is reporting , citing people who claim to have knowledge of the company’s plans. Instead, Apple is now planning to launch AirTag 2 sometime in 2025. Gurman said that Apple “clearly over-produced” the first-generation AirTag, believing that the key finders would be far more popular than they are. Instead, Apple has found that its “retail store back rooms and Apple device storage warehouses are still full to the brim with AirTags,” Gurman writes. There’s been a steady stream of reports in recent months about Apple's next-generation AirTag launch plans. Last year, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple would begin mass production on the AirTag 2 starting in the second half of 2024 , with key features such as extended range coming to the tracking device. Kuo believes that sales rose to 35 million units in 2022 from 20 million the previous year. But this past October, Kuo walked back his claims , saying that Apple had indeed pushed its AirTag 2 launch date to 2025. Gurman’s report similarly acknowledged that Apple wants to deliver a better ultrawideband wireless chip in the AirTag 2 to allow for better and extended range, as well as improved compatibility with existing Apple hardware. That chip will likely be the U2 ultra wideband chip Apple bundled in the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch 9 . The U2 chip can help you find friends in crowded environments with its Precision Finding mode and offers better range. Since those key features are only compatible with U2-equipped hardware, it would make sense for U2 compatibility to come to the next-generation AirTags. Despite that, Gurman’s sources also said that Apple believes the existing AirTags “still work fairly well and have most of the features you’d want,” suggesting U2 compatibility, while important, may not be a deal breaker. And then there’s that pesky issue of excess inventory. Whatever the case, the evidence is mounting that Apple won’t have much to say about AirTag this year. And don’t expect the notoriously secretive Apple to talk about any AirTag plans until it's ready to announce the product's ship date.",

      "content": "Asus took an opportunity at CES 2024 to launch the ROG Phone 8 series, which comprises the 8 and 8 Pro. Both phones run a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, while the 8 Pro brings better cameras and “AniME Vision” LED rear panel. The ROG Phone series has always been directed at gamers. The unique decals on every phone and rear LED paneling made it stand out and further matches Asus’ ROG gaming lineup for PCs. Now, that series gets another iteration with the 8 and 8 Pro. The ROG Phone 8 is the base model, but it doesn’t sacrifice performance in many ways. It runs the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC and is powered by up to 24GB of RAM with 1TB of storage, similar to the ROG Phone 8 Pro. The phones will also carry an Adreno 750 GPU to keep the gaming phone sentiment alive. On the face, the ROG Phone 8 series comes with a 6.78-inch AMOLED display that comes in a resolution of 1080 x 2448 under Gorilla Glass Victus 2. On the back, each device carries a main 50MP sensor and 32MP telephoto unit, supplemented by a 13MP ultrawide. The telephoto lens will be capable of 3x optical zoom. One of the only perceptible main differences in each device is the ROG Phone 8 Pro’s “AniMe Vision” LED paneling, which features hundreds of customizable LED dots for a unique look, based on your preference. Asus’s press release is a bit confusing, but it doesn’t seem to reflect the differences we originally thought were the case with the series, such as a better camera on the Pro model. The ROG Phone 8 will cost $1,100 for the 16GB+256GB model, while the Pro model at 24GB+1TB will cost $1,500. Both will be available in the first quarter of 2024.",

Apple released a short video teasing Apple Vision Pro Wesley Hilliard | Jan 09, 2024 Apple Vision Pro 0 Facebook x.com Reddit Little new information has been shared about Apple Vision Pro since its reveal at WWDC 2023. It's Apple's first spatial computing device that expands on Apple's ecosystem of connected devices. The teaser is like Apple's other short ad-like videos. It's about 30 seconds and will likely appear as an ad spot on YouTube and in other locations. Films referenced in the ad include \"Ant Man,\" \"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" \"Star Wars: A New Hope,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Iron Man,\" and \"Back to the Future Part II.\" Everyone shown is getting ready by lowering their visors or headsets. Interestingly, Apple released developer documentation earlier Monday asking developers not to refer to the Apple Vision Pro as a \"headset\" within apps or descriptions. However, marketing doesn't seem averse to pointing out that Apple's device is very much like a headset or visor seen in sci-fi across decades of film. Apple Vision Pro is available for pre-order on January 19, starting at $3,499 for 256GB of storage. It ships on February 2 and will be available at Apple Stores.",

The fast-paced ad features clips of characters in popular movies and TV shows over the years putting on “headsets” of varying different designs. It’s also a play on the first iPhone ad from 2007… The ad features clips from the likes of Despicable Me, Star Wars, Back to the Future, SpongeBob Squarepants, and Iron Man. The ad is set to the song . In each of the clips, you can see a character putting on a face mask or headset of some sort. The ad concludes with someone putting on Vision Pro: “Get ready,” Apple says. The first iPhone ad in 2007 took a similar approach, showing popular clips from TV shows and movies of characters answering the phone. That iPhone ad was timed with the Oscars and today’s Vision Pro ad comes the day following the Oscars. The Vision Pro ad is also being shown during today’s College Football Playoff National Championship. You can check out the ad below. Pre-orders for Vision Pro will begin Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. PT. Vision Pro will be available beginning Friday, February 2 at all Apple Store locations in the United States. It will also be available from Apple’s Online Store. More on Vision Pro",

      "description": "The upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event will set the standard for every flagship phone in 2024 to be measured against.",
      "content": "Updated January 8: article originally posted January 7 The upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event will set the standard for every flagship phone in 2024 to be measured against. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung’s bid to define the future of smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S23 collection (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) First, the Galaxy S24 Ultra must be the proverbial “really good phone.” There should be no obvious mistakes, nothing weaker than the opposition, and essentially everything a consumer expected from the leading Android flagship must be in the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Samsung’s iterative approach to the Ultra handsets means that the success of the S23 Ultra should easily carry on with the requisite upgrades in the specifications. It’s also worth remembering that the S24 Ultra is part of a family of phones. There is a halo effect with the Galaxy S24 branding, which means the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ handsets also need to be up to standard—any issues with the handset lower down the portfolio will impact the S24 Ultra. That’s one reason why the community is sensitive to the disparity between the Exynos and the Snapdragon chipsets used by the lower-tier models. Luckily for those wanting the ultimate power, the S24 Ultra will exclusively run the more respected Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Samsung. Samsung’s popularity, interest from the press, and leadership role in the Android space will ensure the Galaxy S24 Ultra will be seen as the handset to beat for future flagships. Samsung Galaxy Unpacked invitation (early 2024). Update: Monday January 8. During the company's CES Press Conference, Samsung outlined its wider vision of AI in technology. Titled “ AI For All - Connectivity In The Age Of AI ,” Samsung Device Experience CEO Jong-He ‘JH’ Han introduced several partners and devices that will bring AI to consumers. The traditional meme of the Internet Connected Fridge has been updated with the \"Refrigerator With AI Family Hub,” offering a 32-inch display reporting on the products the AI recognizes inside the fridge with recipe suggestions and tracking of use-by dates. A similar AI hub is part of the Laundry Combo, offering AI in a washer and dryer. On the consumer electronics side, Samsung took the opportunity to showcase the AI features in its recently launched Galaxy Book4 laptop. While there was no specific mention of the Galaxy S24 family, the entire presentation had a smartphone-shaped hole in it. A hole that will be packed by the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event. Samsung product launch in 2019 (Photo: JOSH EDELSON/AFP/Getty Images) The upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event will lean heavily toward using artificial intelligence on the smartphone. If you haven't seen the signs, the invitation screaming \"Galaxy AI is coming” gives the game away. The South Korean company is not going into the event cold. Its Samsung Gauss AI system was given an official launch at the end of 2023 Several specific AI features have already been trailed around the camera, Zoom with Galaxy AI was showcased in the teaser videos ahead of the Galaxy Unpacked events. More importantly, both Qualcomm and Samsung have ensured that the respective Snapdragon and Exynos chipsets have dedicated hardware to enhance AI and ML software routines. Samsung’s Exynos joins and reinforces Qualcomm’s snapdragon, MediaTek's Dimensity, and Google’s Tensor in offering hardware support for AI and ML routines. That means the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra handsets—which could easily have used a different vision of hardware to achieve AI—will consolidate the market. This is how AI can be delivered across the Android ecosystem. LSamsung's CES Booth, 2009 (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) In all this, do not discount how comfortable consumers are buying a Samsung device. While Google’s launch of the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro handsets was built around the promise of AI, the market share of Pixel devices and Galaxy devices are not in the same ballpark. Samsung can bring AI to the broadest possible market around the world. Consumers who walk into a store to “buy a new Samsung” will have AI in their hands, first with the S24 family and then throughout the year into the new Galaxy A handsets and the Galaxy Tabs. The practical impact of AI on photography will be part of OneUI, and the “Galaxy AI” will no doubt be mentioned throughout the launch and at every point-of-sale unit. There’s another area where Samsung can set the standard going forward. The company could match Google’s promise of seven years of software and security updates across the Galaxy S range. Google has shown how attractive this is; now, Samsung can force itself to the front of the line in the broader consumer market. Samsung’s focus on delivering AI, consumer confidence in the brand, and an extended support window for software and hardware is how the Galaxy S24 can shape the smartphone world in 2024. Now read the free offers that will be available alongside the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra...",
